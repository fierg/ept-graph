%% ==============================

\par{
	One interesting approach not performed in this scope, is the encoding of Huffman codes after a byte wise RLE. It was assumed to perform worse that the vertical encoding because there has to be one code for every combination of runs and values, thus very long average Huffman codes. Another idea was the substitution of Huffman encoding by another, more sophisticated method like Asymmetric Numeral Systems. This would most likely further improve compression results at the expense of slower computation.
