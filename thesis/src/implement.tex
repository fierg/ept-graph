\label{ch:Implementation}
%% ==============================
All algorithms described have been implemented using Kotlin, because it can be compiled for the Java Virtual Machine and for native execution, therefore it seemed like a good balance between a native implementation and higher language conciseness and fault tolerance. The project is realized as a maven project, to simplify dependency management.

\section{External Libraries}
TODO: jgraph, lets plot, argparser, 
Some external libraries are used throughout this project which was quite simple through the use of maven. \emph{org.junit.jupiter} provided the packages \emph{junit}, \emph{engine} and \emph{api} in version 4.13.2, which allows a simple test unit creation and execution. Multithreading was enabled by use of Kotlin \emph{coroutines} in version 1.7.1, provided by Jetbrains.

\section{Usage}
To enable a convenient usage, the algorithm is obtainable as jar file but it can also be built from sources. It provides a simple command line interface
