%% ==============================
All algorithms described have been implemented using Kotlin, because it can be compiled for the Java Virtual Machine and for native execution, therefore it seemed like a good balance between a native implementation and higher language conciseness and fault tolerance. The project is realized as a maven project, to simplify dependency management. 


\section{External Libraries}
\label{ch:Implementation:sec:Impl:subsec:libs}
Some external libraries are used throughout this project. Most of them provide a set of sealed functionality, like \emph{io.github.jupf.staticlog} which just facilitate the logging features and are not further interesting, therefore most of them are mentioned in Section \ref{ch:Implementation:sec:Impl:subsec:libs:others}, only extensively used ones are described in greater detail. 


\subsection{Others}
\label{ch:Implementation:sec:Impl:subsec:libs:others}
Besides logging, some other basic functionality was added which was quite simple through the use of maven. \emph{org.junit.jupiter} provided the packages \emph{junit}, \emph{engine} and \emph{api} in version 5.6.0, which allows a simple test unit creation and execution. Additionally \emph{assert-j} in version 3.13.2 added extended assertion capabilities to the encoder as well as to the test cases. A modest approach of multithreading was enabled by use of Kotlin \emph{coroutines} in version 1.3.2, provided by Jetbrains. Just by convenience, Googles \emph{guava} was used in version 28.2 for new collection types and a comparator for an array of bytes.

To enable a convenient usage, the algorithm is obtainable as jar file but it can also be built from sources. It provides a simple command line interface
