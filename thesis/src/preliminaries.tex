\section{Notation}
For a string $w = w_0w_1 \dots w_n$ with $w_i \in \{0, 1\}$, for $0 \leq i \leq n$, $w[i]$ represents the symbol $w_i$ at position $i$ in $w$. Let the length of $w$ be $|w| = n$. Concatenation of strings $u$ and $v$ is written as $u \cdot v$. An edge periodic temporal graph, $G = (V, E, \tau)$ (see also \cite{erlebach2020game}) consists of a graph $G = (V, E)$ called the underlying graph and a function $\tau : E \rightarrow \{0, 1\}$ where $\tau$ maps each edge $e$ to a string $\tau(e) \in \{0, 1\}$, such that $e$ exists in a time step $t \geq 0$ if and only if $\tau(e)[t] = 1$, where $\tau(e)[t] := \tau(e)[t~ mod~ |\tau(e)|]$. Every edge $e$ exists in at least one time step, that is, for each edge $e$ there is some $t_e \in [0, |\tau(e)| - 1]$ with $\tau(e)[t_e] = 1$. We abbreviate $i$ repetitions of identical symbols $\sigma$ in $\tau(e)$ as $\sigma^i$. We denote the subgraph of $G$ in time step $t$ with $G(t)$.
