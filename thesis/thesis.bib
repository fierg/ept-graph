abstract = {The data in many disciplines such as social networks, Web analysis, etc. is link-based, and the link structure can be exploited for many different data mining tasks. In this article, we consider the problem of temporal link prediction: Given link data for times 1 through T, can we predict the links at time T + 1? If our data has underlying periodic structure, can we predict out even further in time, i.e., links at time T + 2, T + 3, etc.? In this article, we consider bipartite graphs that evolve over time and consider matrix- and tensor-based methods for predicting future links. We present a weight-based method for collapsing multiyear data into a single matrix. We show how the well-known Katz method for link prediction can be extended to bipartite graphs and, moreover, approximated in a scalable way using a truncated singular value decomposition. Using a CANDECOMP/PARAFAC tensor decomposition of the data, we illustrate the usefulness of exploiting the natural three-dimensional structure of temporal link data. Through several numerical experiments, we demonstrate that both matrix- and tensor-based techniques are effective for temporal link prediction despite the inherent difficulty of the problem. Additionally, we show that tensor-based techniques are particularly effective for temporal data with varying periodic patterns.},

	abstract = {Graph metric learning methods aim to learn the distance metric over graphs such that similar (e.g., same class) graphs are closer and dissimilar (e.g., different class) graphs are farther apart. This is of critical importance in many graph classification applications such as drug discovery and epidemics categorization. Most, if not all, graph metric learning techniques consider the input graph as static, and largely ignore the intrinsic dynamics of temporal graphs. However, in practice, a graph typically has heterogeneous dynamics (e.g., microscopic and macroscopic evolution patterns). As such, labeling a temporal graph is usually expensive and also requires background knowledge. To learn a good metric over temporal graphs, we propose a temporal graph metric learning framework, Temp-GFSM. With only a few labeled temporal graphs, Temp-GFSM outputs a good metric that can accurately classify different temporal graphs and be adapted to discover new subspaces for unseen classes. Each proposed component in Temp-GFSM answers the following questions: What patterns are evolving in a temporal graph? How to weigh these patterns to represent the characteristics of different temporal classes? And how to learn the metric with the guidance from only a few labels? Finally, the experimental results on real-world temporal graph classification tasks from various domains show the effectiveness of our Temp-GFSM.},
