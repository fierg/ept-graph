abstract = {This paper considers a game in which a single cop and a single robber take turns moving along the edges of a given graph G. If there exists a strategy for the cop which enables it to be positioned at the same vertex as the robber eventually, then G is called cop-win, and robber-win otherwise. In contrast to previous work, we study this classical combinatorial game on edge-periodic graphs. These are graphs with an infinite lifetime comprised of discrete time steps such that each edge e is assigned a bit pattern of length , with a 1 in the i-th position of the pattern indicating the presence of edge e in the i-th step of each consecutive block of steps. Utilising the known framework of reachability games, we obtain an time algorithm to decide if a given n-vertex edge-periodic graph is cop-win or robber-win as well as compute a strategy for the winning player (here, L is the set of all edge pattern lengths , and denotes the least common multiple of the set L). For the special case of edge-periodic cycles, we prove an upper bound of on the minimum length required of any edge-periodic cycle to ensure that it is robber-win, where if , and otherwise. Furthermore, we provide constructions of edge-periodic cycles that are cop-win and have length in the case and length in the case.},

	abstract="We study the computational complexity of determining structural properties of edge-periodic temporal graphs (EPGs).  EPGs are time-varying graphs that compactly represent periodic behavior of components of a dynamic network, for example, train schedules on a rail network. In EPGs, for each edge e of the graph, a binary string {\$}{\$}s{\_}e{\$}{\$}sedetermines in which time steps the edge is present, namely e is present in time step t if and only if {\$}{\$}s{\_}e{\$}{\$}secontains a 1 at position {\$}{\$}t {\backslash}mod |s{\_}e|{\$}{\$}tmod|se|. Due to this periodicity, EPGs serve as very compact representations of complex periodic systems and can even be exponentially smaller than classic temporal graphs representing one period of the same system, as the latter contain the whole sequence of graphs explicitly. In this paper, we study the computational complexity of fundamental questions of the new concept of EPGs such as is there a time step or a sliding window of size {\$}{\$}{\backslash}Delta {\$}{\$}$\Delta$in which the graph (1) is minor-free; (2) contains a minor; (3) is subgraph-free; (4) contains a subgraph; with respect to a given minor or subgraph.  We give a detailed parameterized analysis for multiple combinations of parameters for the problems stated above including several algorithms.",

We study the problem of deciding whether a given DFA is composite, the number of DFAs required in a decomposition, decompositions that are based on abstractions, methods to prove primality, and structural properties of DFAs that make the problem simpler or are retained in a decomposition. We also provide an algebraic view of the problem and demonstrate its usefulness for the special case of permutation DFAs.}

abstract = {The data in many disciplines such as social networks, Web analysis, etc. is link-based, and the link structure can be exploited for many different data mining tasks. In this article, we consider the problem of temporal link prediction: Given link data for times 1 through T, can we predict the links at time T + 1? If our data has underlying periodic structure, can we predict out even further in time, i.e., links at time T + 2, T + 3, etc.? In this article, we consider bipartite graphs that evolve over time and consider matrix- and tensor-based methods for predicting future links. We present a weight-based method for collapsing multiyear data into a single matrix. We show how the well-known Katz method for link prediction can be extended to bipartite graphs and, moreover, approximated in a scalable way using a truncated singular value decomposition. Using a CANDECOMP/PARAFAC tensor decomposition of the data, we illustrate the usefulness of exploiting the natural three-dimensional structure of temporal link data. Through several numerical experiments, we demonstrate that both matrix- and tensor-based techniques are effective for temporal link prediction despite the inherent difficulty of the problem. Additionally, we show that tensor-based techniques are particularly effective for temporal data with varying periodic patterns.},

	abstract = {Graph metric learning methods aim to learn the distance metric over graphs such that similar (e.g., same class) graphs are closer and dissimilar (e.g., different class) graphs are farther apart. This is of critical importance in many graph classification applications such as drug discovery and epidemics categorization. Most, if not all, graph metric learning techniques consider the input graph as static, and largely ignore the intrinsic dynamics of temporal graphs. However, in practice, a graph typically has heterogeneous dynamics (e.g., microscopic and macroscopic evolution patterns). As such, labeling a temporal graph is usually expensive and also requires background knowledge. To learn a good metric over temporal graphs, we propose a temporal graph metric learning framework, Temp-GFSM. With only a few labeled temporal graphs, Temp-GFSM outputs a good metric that can accurately classify different temporal graphs and be adapted to discover new subspaces for unseen classes. Each proposed component in Temp-GFSM answers the following questions: What patterns are evolving in a temporal graph? How to weigh these patterns to represent the characteristics of different temporal classes? And how to learn the metric with the guidance from only a few labels? Finally, the experimental results on real-world temporal graph classification tasks from various domains show the effectiveness of our Temp-GFSM.},
